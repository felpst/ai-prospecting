# Overview
AI-Prospecting is a B2B sales intelligence platform that enables sales teams to discover, research, and save high-potential companies using rich filters and AI-powered enrichment. The platform will allow users to search through a comprehensive company dataset, generate AI-enriched company summaries, and manage prospect lists for effective sales outreach.

# Core Features
## 1. Company Search and Discovery
- Users can filter companies based on structured data (company size, industry, location, founding date, etc.)
- Search results are paginated for performance
- AI-powered free-text search capabilities, allowing natural language queries to map to relevant structured fields

## 2. AI-Powered Company Enrichment
- Generate short, insightful summaries of companies by scraping their landing pages
- Process and analyze the content using LLM technology (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Store enriched company data for future reference

## 3. CRM-Style Prospect Management
- Save promising companies to a "Saved Prospects" list
- Access and manage the saved list through a dedicated dashboard
- Organize and prioritize prospects for follow-up

## 4. Advanced AI Discovery (Bonus Feature)
- Support complex natural language search queries
- Leverage external search engines to identify potential matches
- Extract and match company information to database entries

# User Experience
## Primary Users
- Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) looking to build targeted prospect lists
- Account Executives (AEs) researching potential clients
- Sales Managers overseeing prospecting efforts

## Key User Flows
1. Company Search: Users enter filters or natural language queries to discover relevant companies
2. Company Research: Users view company details and request AI-generated summaries
3. Prospect Management: Users save promising companies and manage their prospect lists

# Technical Architecture
## System Components
1. **Frontend Application**
   - React-based web application
   - Responsive UI with reusable components
   - State management for search filters and results

2. **Backend API**
   - Node.js server
   - RESTful API endpoints for data access
   - Background processing for AI enrichment

3. **Database Layer**
   - Storage for company dataset (~24M companies)
   - Document-based storage for flexible schema
   - Efficient indexing for search performance

4. **AI Integration Services**
   - Web scraping module for company landing pages
   - LLM integration for summary generation
   - Optional: Search engine integration for advanced discovery

## Data Models
1. **Company**
   - id: unique identifier
   - website: company website URL
   - name: company name
   - founded: founding year
   - size: employee count
   - locality: city/local area
   - region: state/province
   - country: country
   - industry: company industry category
   - linkedin_url: LinkedIn profile URL
   - enrichment: [optional] AI-generated summary
   - last_enriched: [optional] timestamp of last enrichment

2. **User**
   - id: unique identifier
   - email: user email
   - saved_companies: array of company IDs

## APIs and Integrations
1. **Core API Endpoints**
   - GET /api/companies - List companies with filtering and pagination
   - GET /api/companies/:id - Get company details
   - POST /api/companies/:id/enrich - Generate AI summary
   - GET /api/saved - Get user's saved companies
   - POST /api/saved/:companyId - Save a company
   - DELETE /api/saved/:companyId - Remove from saved list

2. **External Integrations**
   - OpenAI/Anthropic API for LLM-based summaries
   - Web scraper for landing page content
   - [Optional] Search engine API for advanced discovery

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Node.js environment for backend
- MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Caching layer for performance optimization
- Background job processing for AI enrichment tasks

# Development Roadmap
## Phase 1: MVP Foundation
1. Setup project structure and development environment
2. Implement database schema and import company dataset
3. Create basic backend API for company search and filtering
4. Develop frontend search interface with core filters
5. Implement basic pagination for search results

## Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
1. Build company details view
2. Implement web scraping functionality
3. Integrate LLM for company summary generation
4. Create saved companies functionality
5. Develop saved companies dashboard

## Phase 3: UI Polish and Performance Optimization
1. Refine UI/UX with loading states and error handling
2. Implement caching strategy for performance
3. Optimize database queries and indexing
4. Add responsive design for mobile compatibility
5. Implement comprehensive input validation

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (if time permits)
1. Develop advanced natural language search capability
2. Implement external search engine integration
3. Create batch processing for enrichment
4. Add export functionality for saved companies
5. Implement user authentication and multi-user support

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. Database setup and data import must be completed first to enable any search functionality
2. Basic search API must be functional before frontend search implementation
3. Company details view is required before enrichment features
4. Web scraping capability must precede LLM integration
5. Basic company representation is needed before saved companies feature
6. Advanced search features should only be implemented after core functionality is stable

# Risks and Mitigations
## Technical Challenges
- **Challenge**: Processing and searching a large dataset efficiently
  **Mitigation**: Use a subset of data for development, implement proper indexing, pagination

- **Challenge**: Reliable web scraping of company websites
  **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling, rate limiting, and fallback mechanisms

- **Challenge**: Quality of AI-generated summaries
  **Mitigation**: Fine-tune prompts, implement content filtering, consider human review for critical cases

## Resource Constraints
- **Challenge**: Limited development time
  **Mitigation**: Focus on core features first, leave advanced features for later phases

- **Challenge**: Potential API usage costs
  **Mitigation**: Implement caching of enriched data, batch processing where possible, usage limits

# Appendix
## Dataset Details
- Source: company_dataset.json in project root
- Size: ~24 million companies (using a subset for development)
- Fields: id, website, name, founded, size, locality, region, country, industry, linkedin_url

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB (recommended for flexible schema)
- AI: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Scraping: Puppeteer/Playwright

## Performance Targets
- Search results should load in under 1 second
- Enrichment process should complete within 10 seconds
- System should handle at least 100 concurrent users
